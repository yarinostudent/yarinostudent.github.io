                    <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
                        Orleans.
                        Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
                        before
                        Ash
                        Wednesday. Usually there is one major parade each day.
                        many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
                        last
                        five
                        days of the Mardi
                        Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding
                        communities,
                        including parades
                        and balls.</p>

                                was already established.
                                Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were
                                sometimes prohibited by law, and
                                were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In

                            <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold,
                                and
                                purple. The colors were first
                                specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                                inaugural
                                parade in 1872, suggesting that
                                balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific
                                colors
                                were
                                chosen; some accounts
                                suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as
                                opposed
                                to
                                any true symbolism.

                                Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization,
                                presented a
                                theory that the colors were
                                based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's
                                goal
                                may
                                have been to create a tricolor
                                to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white
                                was
                                already heavily used on other
                                national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green,
                                gold
                                and
                                purple in that order complies
                                with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be
                                placed
                                on
                                or next to other colors, and
                                that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

                                Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and
                                gold-colored
                                floats themed around the
                                concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that
                                order
                                symbolized justice, power, and
                                faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in
                                that
                                order—even though this order
                                violates the rule of tincture</p>

                        Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                        term-limited mayor Mitch
                        Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell
                        garnered
                        the most votes,
                        winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow
                        Democratic opponent Desiree
                        Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead
                        New
                        Orleans in its 300-year
                        history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.
